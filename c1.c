// The standard I/O functions return EOF when the underlying read() system calls return 0 bytes available to be read â€” or when there's an error.

// When you type abcControl-Z on Windows (you'd type Control-D instead on Unix), then:

//     The terminal driver makes the characters currently in its buffer (abc) available to the read() system call.
//     The read() system call populates the standard I/O buffer with those characters.
//     The successive getchar() calls return a, b and c.
//     The next getchar() waits for more input.

// This wasn't EOF; it was just flushing the characters on the line to the program. To get the effect of EOF, you'd have to type Control-Z twice in a row after the abc. The first would flush the abc; the second would generate a read() of 0 bytes, indicating EOF.
// The terminal driver also makes input available when a newline (Enter) is pressed. If you type Control-Z immediately after typing Enter, all zero of the characters pending input are sent from the terminal to the program, so the read() returns 0, so the standard I/O package reports EOF.
// Note that until you hit enter or the EOF indication, you can edit the data in the line with the backspace and other editing options, including deleting all the data. Once you've hit enter or the EOF indication, you can no longer edit the data that was made available to read().
// The analogous behaviour occurs on Unix; you type the EOF indication twice to terminate the input mid-line; once to terminate the input at the start of a line.
